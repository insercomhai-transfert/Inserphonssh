# Private Workbooks Deprecation
The ability to save changes to existing private workbooks is going away by July 1st, 2021. You will still be able to access your private workbooks but any edit or save can only be saved as a Shared Workbook. 

# How should you proceed?
If you choose to migrate your private workbook to a shared one, you can go to your private workbook and click "Save As" and select the "Shared Report" option from the drop down. If you don't want others to have access to your workbook, you can always manually change the RBAC to deny access to others.

# How do I know if my workbook is private or not?

One of the easiest ways is to identify a private workbook and shared workbook by their icon on the gallery view. The private workbook will have a blue icon with a person figure in the corner. The shared workbook will have a green icon with a stack figure in the corner.
